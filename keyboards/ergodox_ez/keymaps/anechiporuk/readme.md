# Description

## Considirations
That configuration is based on a few facts from my usage patterns
1) I use DVORAK layout
2) I use both Ergodox and laptop keyboard
3) I use both Windows and Linux
4) I use other languages then English
5) I use vim
6) I couldn't get used to hjkl, I prefer reversed T for movements
7) In Linux I use tiled window manager, so Win key is used extensively

## Consequences
- (2) => I have to use QUERTY layout on ergodox and setup DVORAK in OS
- (4) => I have to take other languages layouts into account, some symbol keys have letters on them
- (2) => some keys are better to leave in default position, because I use them on laptop keyboard (Esc, Tab, Backspace, Ctrl)

# What I tried
- Autoshift, nice feature, but adds to much of a delay. But it's still nice for symbols
